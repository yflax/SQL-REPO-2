# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
My goal for this project was to fullfill all the requirements outlined in the instuctions and the rubric.
## Process
### (your step 1) I began my first step with analyzing the data and noting the columns that abviosuly needed transformation. I  then wrote a list of all the cleaning the was necessary  and started with the all_sessions table which was the longest one. Cleaning the data was the bulk of my project preparation and I occasionaly noticed mre clomuns that need cleaning as I was answering and writing questions in other sections ; so it was really an ongoing process - which could be still be perfected. 
### (your step 2) I started reading and trying to understand the questions before answering them. My cohort peers were really helpful throughtout by suggesting different perspective to tackling the questions.
### Next, I started setting up primary and foreign keys and I think more transforming and column creating is necessary for me to connect all tables.
### Quality assurance.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
I discoverd the data gave me info about the amount of visitors who came to the website, how long they stayed , the produts that were ordered and the countries they were ordered from and much more...

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
there were many ! For one, my  all _session table got deleted - after I had spent two days cleaning and transforimng the data. Luckily, Amer Abu Rashid suggested saving the transformed columns that were not lost as a csv file , and thenuploading the original extracted date into that csv file so that I do not have to completely start over agian. 
THe questions also prompted me to really try to understand the date and the postgresql functions.
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?) If I had more time I would clean all the date , and reomve unnecessary coumns, create a a new column with ditinct fullvisitorids on analytics and set it as the primary key , then use the fullvisitor id from all_session to connect more tables to each other.
I would spend more time on each section in order to clean everything, and check the validity of the data.
